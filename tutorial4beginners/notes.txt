Here are the notes for all of this lesson: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfkTfcpWqAY

C# vs. .NET
C# is a programming language and .NET is a framework for building applications for windows...it's not
limited to C#

.NET is comprised of two things:
1. CLR(Common Language Runtime) - Compiles application code to machine code for running. Uses 'JIT', or
'Just in Time' code

2. Class Library

History of C#:
Microsoft wanted a language that could be translated to machine code on Linux AND windows...
so they borrowed ideas from Java. CLR is an application that is used to translate the machine language

------------------------------------------
.Net applications architrecture:
Applications are made up of classes

Classes - Contain data and Methods/functions
Namespace - Container for related classes

Assembly - A container for related namespaces. It can be an executable or 'DLL',
or 'Dynamically Listed Language'.

Application - A build up of assemblys

'Your First Program' Section
NOTE: Not quite sure how to work on this in VS code...so maybe I should start with Visual Studio :(
Look at video section for how to set a project up in Visual Studio

It's a lot like Java...if you want to use different namespaces, you'll need 
to import them at the top with the following: using NAME-OF-NAMESPACE.

Here are some common imports:
using System; //Uses a bunch of stuff within .NET framework
using System.Collecitons.Generic; //Used to work with lists, collections 
using System.Linq; //Used to work with data
using System.Text //Used to work with text/coding
using System.Threading.Tasks; //Used for multi-threading in an application

Within an applicaiton, you should have a program class...inside that is a 'Main' function, 
which is an entrypoint to the application. Example:

namespace HelloWorld
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            
        }
    }
}

TBH, this might look a little different, based on what version of .NET you have...

To run the application:
CTRL + 5 
You can click start on the green arrow on the top.
You can also click 'Debug', then 'Start Debug'

'bin' folder contains the binary file that the computer runs
