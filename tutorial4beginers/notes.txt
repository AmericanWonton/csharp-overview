C# is a programming language and .NET is a framework for building applications for windows...it's not
limited to C#

.NET is comprised of two things:
1. CLR(Common Language Runtime) - Compiles application code to machine code for running. Uses 'JIT', or
'Just in Time' code

2. Class Library

History of C#:
Microsoft wanted a language that could be translated to machine code on Linux AND windows...
so they borrowed ideas from Java. CLR is an application that is used to translate the machine language
