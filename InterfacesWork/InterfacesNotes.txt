An 'Interface' is a contract. It says,
"Here's a thing...that will have a thing you can work with"

FOr example, click 'Add', 'New Item', 'Interface'

Naming Convention is a capital I, followed by Pascalcase Variable

EVERYTHING in the interface is public....so no variables need to be valued as such


There's no code in here...just things you should have.

A 'Signature is just the important bits of the code

If you want to add the neccessary propertys to classes that are going to be under the interface, you can highlight
it, then press CTRL + . ,(14:13).

You can remove the exception given and just set the property like a normal class would...
that's just a microsoft safety feature

We also gave the DIgitalProductModel a set as well...we can do that, becuase it fufills the get
from the promise of the interface
